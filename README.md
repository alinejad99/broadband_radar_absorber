# broadband_radar_absorber (in COMSOL)

The objective of this project is to design a radar absorber using a periodic structure composed of dielectric and conductive materials. The structure consists of a one-dimensional periodic array of slots, as shown in Figure 1.4. The region above and between the slots is considered free space. Additionally, assume that a metallic array is present on a dielectric substrate with a refractive index (ns) according to the provided table.

Structure Parameters Calculation
The structure's parameters are calculated as follows, using the given formula (Equation 1):

n_s = 4.4
F_ref = 65 GHz
f_0 = 2 GHz

h = λ/4
d = λ/20
w = (1 - 1/√ns) * λ/20

In this calculation, consider the design frequency based on Table (f_ref) and λ as the corresponding wavelength at that frequency in free space.

Simulation Steps
Design the structure using the calculated parameters.
Simulate the structure using 2D electromagnetic simulation software like COMSOL.
Illuminate the structure with a TM-polarized wave incident from above.
Tasks and Reporting
a) Plot the reflection coefficient (reflection coefficient vs. frequency) for the structure in the frequency range from f_ref * 0.5 to f_ref * 1.5.

b) If the reflection coefficient is not zero at the desired frequency, try slightly adjusting the value of h to shift the frequency response.

c) Plot the magnetic field components in the frequency range corresponding to the design frequency.

Ensure that you perform the simulation and design steps according to the instructions provided, and report the results of each task.
